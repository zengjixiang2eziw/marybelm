Description: Generates a status line for dzen2, xmobar or i3bar
 i3status is a small (about 1500 SLOC) and light-weight program for generating
 a status bar for i3bar, dzen2, xmobar or similar programs by combining several
 information about your system (IP addresses of your interfaces, load, current
 date/time, ESSID of the network you are associated to, disk status, and so on).
